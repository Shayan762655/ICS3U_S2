# Task A
# The output will be:
# Welcome to Sanjay's Koala Party!
# It's possible Sanjay can distribute  12
#  cookies for each bowl.

# my prediction was correct
# fix the program so that there is one space before and after "12":
print("Welcome to Sanjay's Koala Party!")
print("It's possible Sanjay can distribute", 12)
print("cookies for each bowl.")

#task B:
print("Sanjay has", 6, "bowls for", 144, "cookies")
# you can also do
print("Sanjay has %d bowls for %d cookies" % (6,144))

#task C:
print("The number of cookies per bowl is:", 144/6)
#there is one text value and one number value (two numbers being divided with the / operator)
